# TA0028 - Persistence

### MITRE ATT&CK: https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0028/

The adversary is trying to maintain their foothold.

Persistence is any access, action, or configuration change to a mobile device that gives an attacker a persistent presence on the device. Attackers often will need to maintain access to mobile devices through interruptions such as device reboots and potentially even factory data resets.
