# TA0029 - Privilege Escalation

### MITRE ATT&CK: https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0029/

The adversary is trying to gain higher-level permissions.

Privilege escalation includes techniques that allow an attacker to obtain a higher level of permissions on the mobile device. Attackers may enter the mobile device with very limited privileges and may be required to take advantage of a device weakness to obtain higher privileges necessary to successfully carry out their mission objectives.
