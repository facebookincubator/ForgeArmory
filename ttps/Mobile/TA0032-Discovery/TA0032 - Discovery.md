# TA0032 - Discovery

### MITRE ATT&CK: https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0032/

The adversary is trying to figure out your environment.

Discovery consists of techniques that allow the adversary to gain knowledge about the characteristics of the mobile device and potentially other networked systems. When adversaries gain access to a new system, they must orient themselves to what they now have control of and what benefits operating from that system give to their current objective or overall goals during the intrusion. The operating system may provide capabilities that aid in this post-compromise information-gathering phase.
