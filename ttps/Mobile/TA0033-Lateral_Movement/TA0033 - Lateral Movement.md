# TA0033 - Lateral Movement

### MITRE ATT&CK: https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0033/

The adversary is trying to move through your environment.

Lateral movement consists of techniques that enable an adversary to access and control remote systems on a network and could, but does not necessarily, include execution of tools on remote systems. The lateral movement techniques could allow an adversary to gather information from a system without needing additional tools, such as a remote access tool.
