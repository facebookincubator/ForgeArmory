# TA0034 - Impact

### MITRE ATT&CK: https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0034/

The adversary is trying to manipulate, interrupt, or destroy your devices and data.

The impact tactic consists of techniques used by the adversary to execute his or her mission objectives but that do not cleanly fit into another category such as Collection. Mission objectives vary based on each adversary's goals, but examples include toll fraud, destruction of device data, or locking the user out of his or her device until a ransom is paid.
