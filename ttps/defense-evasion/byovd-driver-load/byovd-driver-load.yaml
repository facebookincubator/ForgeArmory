authors:

description: |
  This TTP uses a Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) technique to load the
  vulnerable TfSysMon kernel driver via the Windows Service Control Manager. Once loaded,
  it communicates with the driver via DeviceIoControl to terminate security processes
  (such as Windows Defender and EDR components) by PID.

  The driver can be provided locally or downloaded from a specified URL with SHA-256
  integrity verification.
