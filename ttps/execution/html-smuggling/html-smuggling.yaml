name: "HTML Smuggling Attack Chain"
authors:

description: |
  This TTP simulates an HTML smuggling attack chain consisting of three components:

  1. index.html - An HTML page that dynamically loads a malicious JavaScript file from a C2 server
  2. loader.js - JavaScript that reconstructs a base64-encoded executable and triggers a download
  3. attachment.c - C source code for a payload that discovers Python on the system,
     writes and executes an information-gathering script

  The attack flow demonstrates how malicious content can be delivered through a browser
  using JavaScript and HTML without being detected by network security tools.
