# Execute SwiftSpy to perform keylog monitoring

![Meta TTP](https://img.shields.io/badge/Meta_TTP-blue)

This TTP executes SwiftSpy to monitor keyboard strokes.

## Pre-requisites

1. The code must be executed on a macOS system.
1. The user must have the necessary permissions to access the TCC folder and
   compile Swift code:
      1. Open `Spotlight`
      1. Input `Privacy & Security` and hit enter
      1. Scroll down to `Input Monitoring` and left-click it
      1. Click the `+`, input your password, and find your terminal emulator.
         For example, if you are using `iTerm2` to run the `TTPForge`,
         you will want to specify the path to that binary, which is typically
         `/Applications/iTerm.app`

1. macOS Developer tools must be installed as the TTP requires Swift. To install
   developer tools:

   ```bash
   xcode-select --install
   ```

## Examples

You can run the TTP using the following example:

```bash
ttpforge run forgearmory//discovery-and-collection/macos/swiftspy-exec/swiftspy-exec.yaml
```

## Steps

1. **swiftspy-exec**: This step first compiles the SwiftSpy source file
   into a binary and then executes it with a 20-second timeout. If there
   are any issues with permissions, it will notify the user.

## Accompanying Code

The Expect script used in this TTP is responsible for spawning a bash shell
and executing the compiled SwiftSpy binary.
