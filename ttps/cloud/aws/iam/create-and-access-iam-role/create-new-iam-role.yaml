name: create_iam_role
description: |
  This TTP is used to create a new IAM role in AWS. It uses the AWS CLI to create a new role with the specified name.
  If a role with given name exists, nothing is done and the TTP is closed.
  If a role does not exist a new role is created. It is also deleted during cleanup.
  A malicious trust policy is also attached to this role that provides an attacker AWS account to assume this role.
  `--no-cleanup` options should be explicity specified if we do not want the new role created to be deleted.

  - name: iam_role_name

    default: ttpforge_trojan_role
  - name: attacker_account_id
