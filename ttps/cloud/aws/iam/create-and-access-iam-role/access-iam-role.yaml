description: |
  This TTP is used to access an existing backdoored IAM role from a compromised AWS account.
  If a role with given name exists, nothing is done and the TTP is closed.
  If a role does not exist a new role is created. It is also deleted during cleanup.
  Since we are creating a role that can act as a backdoor, an AWS account ID of a backdoor account is required.
  `--no-cleanup` options should be explicity specified if we do not want the new role created to be deleted.

args:
  - name: iam_role_name
    description: The name of the  backdoored IAM role to be assumed.
    default: ttpforge_trojan_role
  - name: backdoor_account_id
    description: AWS account ID which has been backdoored for access via attacker controled IAM role
